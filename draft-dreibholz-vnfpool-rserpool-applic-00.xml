<t>
 An overview of the RSerPool framework -- which is defined as RFC in <xref target="RFC5351" /> -- is provided in <xref target="fig:rserpool-overview" />. There are three types of components:
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>Pool Element (PE) denotes a server in a pool. PEs in the same pool provide the same service.</t>
  <t>Pool User (PU) denotes a client using the service of a pool.</t>
  <t>Pool Registrar (PR) is the management component for the pools.</t>
 </list> 
 The set of all pools within an operation scope (e.g. an organization, a company or a department) is denoted as handlespace. Clearly, a single PR would be a single point of failure. Therefore, PRs also have to be redundant. Within the handlespace, each pool is identified by a unique pool handle (PH).
</t>
</section>


<section title="Registrar Operations">
<t>
 The PRs of an operation scope synchronize their view of the handlespace by using the Endpoint haNdlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP, defined as RFCs in <xref target="RFC5353" />, <xref target="RFC5354" />). In contrast to for instance the Domain Name System (DNS), an operation scope is restricted to a single administrative domain. That is, all of its components are under the control of the same authority (for example: a company). This property leads to small management overhead, which also allows for RSerPool usage on devices having only limited memory and CPU resources (for example: telecommunications equipment). Nevertheless, PEs may be distributed globally to continue their service even in case of localized disasters (like for example an earthquake). Each PR in the operation scope is identified by a PR ID, which is a randomly chosen 32-bit number.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Pool Element Operations">
<t>
 Within their operation scope, the PEs may choose an arbitrary PR to register into a pool by using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP, defined as RFCs in <xref target="RFC5352" />, <xref target="RFC5354" />). The registration is performed by using an ASAP Registration message. Within its pool, a PE is characterized by its PE ID, which is a randomly chosen 32-bit number. Upon registration at a PR, the chosen PR becomes the Home-PR (PR-H) of the newly registered PE. A PR-H is responsible for monitoring the availability of its PEs by ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE messages (to be acknowledged by a PE via an ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK message within a configured timeout). The PR-H propagates the information about its PEs to the other PRs of the operation scope via ENRP Update messages.
</t>
<t>
 PEs re-register regularly in an interval denoted as registration lifetime and for information updates. Similar to the registration, a re-registration is performed by using another ASAP Registration message. PEs may intentionally deregister from the pool by using an ASAP Deregistration message. Also like for the registration, the PR-H makes the deregistration known to the other PRs within the operation scope by using an ENRP Update message.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Takeover Procedure">
<t>
 As soon as a PE detects the failure of its PR-H (i.e. its request is not answered within a given timeout), it simply tries another PR of the operation scope for its registration and deregistration requests. However, as a double safeguard, the remaining PRs also negotiate a takeover of the PEs managed by a dead PR. This ensures that each PE again gets a working PR-H as soon as possible. The PRs of an operation scope monitor the availability of each other PR by using ENRP_PRESENCE messages, which are transmitted regularly. If there is no ENRP_PRESENCE within a given timeout, the peer is assumed to be dead and a so-called takeover procedure (see also <xref target="AINA2009" /> for more details) is initiated for the PEs managed by the dead PR: from all PRs having started this takeover procedure, the PR with the highest PR ID takes over the ownership of these PEs. The PEs are informed about being taken over by their new PR-H via an ASAP Endpoint Keep-Alive with Home-flag set. The PEs are requested to adopt the sender of this Home-flagged message as their new PR-H.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Pool User Operations">

<section title="Handle Resolution and Response">
<t>
 In order to access the service of a pool given by its PH, a PU requests a PE selection from an arbitrary PR of the operation scope, again by using ASAP. This selection procedure is denoted as handle resolution. Upon reception of a so-called ASAP Handle Resolution message the PR selects the requested list of PE identities and returns them in an ASAP Handle Resolution Response message.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Pool Member Selection Policies">
<t>
 The pool-specific selection rule is denoted as pool member selection policy or shortly as pool policy. Two classes of load distribution policies are supported: non-adaptive and adaptive strategies (a detailed overview is provided by <xref target="Dre2006" />, <xref target="LCN2005" />, <xref target="IJHIT2008" />. While adaptive strategies base their selections on the current PE state (which requires up-to-date information), non-adaptive algorithms do not need such data. A basic set of adaptive and non-adaptive pool policies is defined as RFC by <xref target="RFC5356" />.
</t>
<t>
 Defined in <xref target="RFC5356" /> are the non-adaptive policies Round Robin (RR), Random (RAND) and Priority (PRIO) as well as the adaptive policies Least Used (LU) and Least Used with Degradation (LUD).
 While RR/RAND select PEs in turn/randomly, PRIO selects one of the PEs having the highest priority. PRIO can for example be used to realise a master/backup PE setup. Only if there are no master PEs left, a backup PE is selected. Round-robin selection is applied among PEs having the same priority.
 LU selects the least-used PE, according to up-to-date application-specific load information. Round robin selection is applied among multiple least-loaded PEs. LUD, which is evaluated by <xref target="ICDS2008-LUD" />, furthermore introduces a load decrement constant that is added to the actual load each time a PE is selected. It is used to compensate inaccurate load states due to delayed updates. An update resets the load to the actual load value.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Handle Resolution and Response">
<t>
 PE may fail, for example due to hardware or network failures. Since there is a certain latency between the actual failure of a PE and the removal of its entry from the handlespace -- depending on the interval and timeout for the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE monitoring -- the PUs may report unreachable PEs to a PR by using an ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE message. A PR locally counts these reports for each PE and when reaching the threshold MAX-BAD-PE-REPORT (default is 3, as defined in the RFC <xref target="RFC5352" />), the PR may decide to remove the PE from the handlespace. The counter of a PE is reset upon its re-registration. More details on this threshold and guidelines for its configuration can be found in <xref target="IJAIT2009" />.
</t>
</section>

</section>


<section anchor="subsub:Automatic-Configuration" title="Automatic Configuration">
<t>
 RSerPool components need to know the PRs of their operation scope. While it is of course possible to configure a list of PRs into each component, RSerPool also provides an auto-configuration feature: PRs may send so-called announces, i.e. ASAP Announce and ENRP_PRESENCE messages which are regularly sent over UDP via IP multicast. Unlike broadcasts, multicast messages can also be transported over routers (at least, this is easily possible within LANs). The announces of the PRs can be heard by the other components, which can maintain a list of currently available PRs. That is, RSerPool components are usually just turned on and everything works automatically.
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="subsub:State-Synchronisation" title="State Synchronisation">
<t>
 RSerPool has been explicitly designed to be application-independent. Therefore, RSerPool has not intended to define special state synchronisation mechanisms for RSerPool-based applications. Such state synchronisation mechanisms are considered as tasks of the applications themselves. However, RSerPool defines two mechanisms to at least support the implementation of more sophisticated strategies: Cookies and Businesss Cards. Details on these mechanisms can also be found in <xref target="Dre2006" />.
</t>

<section title="Cookies">
<t>
 ASAP provides the mechanism of Client-Based State Sharing as introduced in <xref target="LCN2002" />. Whenever useful, the PE may package its state in form of a state cookie and send it -- by an ASAP_COOKIE message -- to the PU. The PU stores the latest state cookie received from the PE. Upon PE failure, this stored cookie is sent in an ASAP COOKIE_ECHO to the newly chosen PE. This PE may then restore the state. A shared secret known by all PEs of a pool may be used to protect the state from being manipulated or read by the PU.
</t>
<t>
 While Client-Based State Sharing is very simple, it may be inefficient when the state changes too frequently, is too large (the size limit of an ASAP COOKIE/ASAP COOKIE_ECHO is 64 KiB) or if it must be prevented that a PU sends a state cookie to multiple PEs in order to increase its number of sessions.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Businesss Cards">
</section>

</section>


<section title="Protocol Stack">
<t>
 The protocol stack of a PR provides ENRP and ASAP services to PRs and PEs/PUs respectively. But between PU and PE, ASAP provides a Session Layer protocol in the OSI model. From the perspective of the Application Layer, the PU side establishes a session with a pool. ASAP takes care of selecting a PE of the pool, initiating and maintaining the underlying transport connection and triggering a failover procedure when the PE becomes unavailable.
</t>
<t>
  The Transport Layer protocol is by default SCTP (as defined in <xref target="RFC4960" /> -- except for the UDP-based automatic configuration announces (see <xref target="subsub:Automatic-Configuration" />) -- over possibly multi-homed IPv4 and/or IPv6. SCTP has been chosen due to its support of multi-homing and its reliability features (see also <xref target="Dre2012" />).
